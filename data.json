After using Wix a few years before her, I knew it was a tool she could use to get a basic website up and running to start promoting her services. Fast forward 2 years, I now manage and update her Wix website and use several features to optimise her website and its performance.",

As a small company that has traditionally reached clients and candidates through referrals, word-of-mouth and in-person events, our website and blog are certainly important but we have yet to see a need to tap outside resources for enhancing the design or populating the content. Thus, one person has been managing essentially every component, from developing content to promoting that content to tracking a variety of metrics. Wix was the platform they wanted to work off because of its user-friendliness, its sleek style, and the formatting and visual options it offers users. We have accounts with other website editors and content generators, but Wix is what was found to be most agreeable.",
